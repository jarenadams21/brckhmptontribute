                    <p>Best known as a founding member of rap group Brockhampton, Texas rapper and singer/songwriter Kevin Abstract's dreamy, introspective songs blur the lines between hip-hop, pop, R&B, and alternative rock. His lyrics reflect on depression, relationships, drug use, and his position as an outcast in society, having relocated several times during his life and come out of the closet. In addition to his work with Brockhampton, he also released solo efforts, including his debut MTV1987 and 2019's Billboard-charting Arizona Baby.

                        Born <strong>Clifford Ian Simpson</strong> in Corpus Christi, Texas in 1996, he was heavily influenced by Nirvana, Will Smith (as both a rapper and actor), and Kanye West, among others. He began making music as a high school student, started releasing mixtapes in 2009, and formed a collective called AliveSinceForever in 2011.</p>

                    <p>Matt Champion grew up in The Woodlands near Houston, where he was raised alongside his younger sister by their single mother, who worked as a hairdresser at that time. Champion studied at Woodlands High School, and during his time there, he started making music. Two years after matriculating, Matt dropped out of college and moved to Los Angeles, California, to focus on his music career. In 2014, he responded to Kevin Abstractâ€™s post on the online forum for Kanye West fans, KanyeToThe, asking to recruit new members for his band, which is how he met his future Brockhampton band-mates Kevin Abstract, Ameer Vann, Joba, and Merlyn Wood.</p>
